# üí≥ ATM System (Java Console Application)

## üìå Project Description

This is a simple **ATM System** built in Java using **file-based storage** and **encapsulation**. It runs in the console and allows users to:

* Check their balance
* Deposit money
* Withdraw money

The project uses **Java I/O** for data handling and demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles like **encapsulation** through a clean model and DAO structure.

# 💳 ATM System (Java Console Application)

## 📌 Project Description

This is a simple **ATM System** built in Java using **file-based storage** and **encapsulation**. It runs in the console and allows users to:

* Check their balance
* Deposit money
* Withdraw money

The project uses **Java I/O** for data handling and demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles like **encapsulation** through a clean model and DAO structure.

## 🔗 GitHub Repo Structure

* Make sure each folder (`model`, `dao`, `ui`, `main`) contains its respective `.java` files.
* Include `.gitignore` if needed (e.g., to ignore IDE files).
* Include `data/accounts.txt` with sample users.
